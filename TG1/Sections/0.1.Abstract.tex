With the advent of the fifth generation of mobile networks, new functionalities were adde, making these networks increasingly complex.
The increase in the processing capacity of general-purpose processors allowed the cores of mobile networks to run in software, reducing the deployment costs of these networks, but making them more susceptible to implementation errors.
This work carries out a literature review bringing the advances of mobile networks from its beginning to the fifth generation, making a survey on tests in open source implementations of mobile networks core.
Finally, a method is proposed to test the performance of some implementations of mobile networks core form the fifth generation in order to evaluate the behavior of these implementations under heavy workload.
